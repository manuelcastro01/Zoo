<p class="tituloensayo ">Can DevOps help with code quality assurance?</p>
<p class="tituloensayo" style="font-size:100%;">By Cristian Arenas </p>

  Agile methodologies have taken more and more popularity in the last decade over tech industries, and specifically in programming teams. One of the most popular techniques that comes from agile (but it is not an agile methodology) is DevOps, that is defined as a combination of the Development and Operations areas to offer constant added value to the clients. The cloud giants Amazon and Azure agree in that DevOps allows isolated teams like development, IT operations, security, or quality engineering to be coordinated and collaborate in a joint way to produce new and better products. That’s why DevOps offers an interesting alternative for quality improvement in most of programming scenarios leading into a code quality enhance.<br><br>
  The Amazon DevOps team (2022) suggests that development operation support a mix of cultural, practices and tools philosophies that can increase the capability an organization has to provide applications and services for their customers in a quickly way. Usually these processes have two “father” processes that are software development (what you want to run) and infrastructure management (where you want to run the software you created) that need to be integrated over them, and that could consume a lot of time.  Amazon suggests that DevOps teams could have many approaches like velocity o assurance, but quality is one of the most popular ones in this environment, because even you have the world’s best programmers, you always will have a chance to get a failure. In this approach the Development part of DevOps could take an important leverage because the infrastructure can keep the same over all the software deployments, naturally adapting to the application and stakeholder needs, but when we talk about software quality, we need many iterations to deploy, test and rewrite code to improve the application quality, purging periodically all bugs an application could have in each new deployment. Well said, code quality assurance needs an iterative process or technique to be constantly improved in a production environment.<br><br>
  One of the main advantages that DevOps offers is the velocity, but this can be seen as a disadvantage for mechanistic organizations that tend to use some other technique for methodologies for application deployment. The change resilience can have an important place when a company is trying to implement these new techniques, and this goes by the hand with some new knowledges required in both development and operations areas. Instinctools (2021) claims that most of DevOps failures rises in the first terms after implementing this framework and are often related with the team expectations, around 90% of DevOps teams agree in that DevOps did not meet their expectations in their first deployment, and I we think a little bit on this, it could be logic that the first time you do something, you probably will use more time to do it. This summary also suggest that DevOps is not suitable for all companies due to the way they are built and the way they work with their internal or external stakeholders.<br><br>
  Amazon offers many examples about how a company can implement DevOps practices in many fields, most important ones for code quality assurance can be continuous integration, that is a software development practice that allow you to combinate and change code and test in a periodically manner and let us identify and fix bugs and errors more quickly reducing the time spent in publishing and validating new updates; the other one is the monitoring and registry practice that lead the teams  know how the applications is performing in relation with the hardware they have and how the operations team can make or suggest an improvement to the development team to take advantage of the infrastructure they have, or even discovering if there is any component failing or using more resources than expected. The code quality improvements require many actions and practices that could be implicit in techniques like DevOps and can lead organizations to infrastructure efficiency or cost reduction.<br><br>
  To conclude, we can say that code assurance quality is important for organizational success and stakeholder management, but not always can be reaches by using or implementing techniques like DevOps that even allow you to find errors and bugs, and improve your application deployments, is not always suitable for some tech teams or companies that present a different way to operate due to their natural business essence. By other side, if implemented in the right way in the right teams, DevOps techniques could lead organizations and teams to achieve efficiency when deploying their own code or applications and reducing the costs or simply improving the time needed to realize new changes on existing applications.
